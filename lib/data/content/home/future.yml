introduction: 
  - Thank you very much for reading our Annual Review. The past 40 years of UNEP-WCMC’s history have shown what can be accomplished when we work together, and we will need every ounce of that collaboration and passion as the global community moves towards defining the next decade of goals for the natural world.
  - Please visit our website to learn about how we could work together to confront the challenges facing our world’s biodiversity, whether that’s through joining our team, building a collaboration or extending a partnership. Together, We Can Make Change.
