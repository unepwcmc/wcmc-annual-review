title: Looking ahead
introduction:
  -
    2022 is busy with opportunities to respond to the growing political recognition of nature’s critical role in ensuring climate resilience and sustainable development. Not least, we will see the adoption of new global ambitions for nature, during the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal. UNEP-WCMC has worked hard over recent years to support development of this framework, and we look forward to supporting their implementation and ensuring transparency across countries and the international community. The focus now must be stepping up action – not just more commitments – for nature.
  -
    The Centre will continue to play a key role in helping governments monitor their commitments, better understand the need for joined-up action on nature and climate and maximise opportunities for integrated, national planning that embeds biodiversity across the whole of government.
  -
    In supporting the rollout of a shared strategy for mainstreaming biodiversity across the UN system, we will ensure action for nature is an integral as progress is made on sustainable development.
  -
    The past year has seen a sizable expansion of UNEP-WCMC’s internal capacity, as well as our outward-facing impact, reflecting the growing global demand for actionable insights on nature. Our growth comes at a time of strengthened organisational focus, with the launch of our ${link-wcmc-strategy} at the beginning of this year that clearly defines the innovative approaches and priority thematic impact areas in which we will focus and accelerate our work.
  -
    The Centre’s core technical expertise in spatial intelligence and modelling will continue to advance conservation science, policy and practice, developing scenarios and metrics to help plot pathways to a sustainable future. Engaging at the heart of various multilateral environmental agreements, our policy focus will support governments to plan and deliver, and strengthen considerations of gender and human rights across our work and partnerships. We will continue to produce cutting-edge digital tools to guide countries, businesses and civil society to make the right choices for nature, as well as progressing a growing UNEP-WCMC initiative to integrate myriad biodiversity data platforms.
  -
    Our new priority impact areas clearly define our commitment to helping humanity to protect and sustainably use nature. UNEP-WMC will continue to champion the expansion and effective use of protected areas via our flagship Protected Planet work, as well as supporting international efforts to increase ecological connectivity and ensure the sustainability of wildlife trade. We will continue to showcase the benefits of both ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions and help all stakeholders to adopt and scale up actions in these areas. To help shape systemic transformations in society and the economy, UNEP-WCMC will work with governments and businesses to strengthen the use of tools and insights to expedite progress towards a nature-positive world.
  - 
    Our work is driven by the global demand for solutions to combat the nature crisis, alongside the shared vision of a world living in harmony with nature. Through 2022 and beyond, we will continue to drive innovation and impact through collaboration, building even stronger partnerships with researchers, policy leaders and businesses around the world to realize lasting benefits for people and the planet.
