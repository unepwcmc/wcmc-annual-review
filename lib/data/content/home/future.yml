introduction: 
  - Thank you very much for reading our Annual Review. 
  - The past 40 years of UNEP-WCMC’s history have shown what can be accomplished when we work together. We look forward to bringing our experience and expertise to bear into the future, including as the global community moves towards determining the next decade of goals for the natural world, and as global consciousness on the big environmental challenges of our time continues to grow.
  - Please visit our website to learn about how we could work together to confront the challenges facing our world’s biodiversity, whether that’s through joining our team, building a collaboration or extending a partnership. Together, for the benefit of people and nature, We Can Make Change.
