title: Moving forward
introduction:
  -
    2020 marks the beginning of a critical decade for the planet. This is partly due to landmark moments early in the decade, including the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming that is anticipated to adopt a new global biodiversity framework, and the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow. There will also be the launch of the UN’s Decade of Action on Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.
  -
    Beyond the landmark moments and initiatives, the 2020s are critical because we now have a clear and robust evidence base showing the urgency of changing course; we must rebalance the relationship between people and nature.
  -
    Over the past 40 years, UNEP-WCMC has led the way in bringing the understanding of ecosystem change and its significance to public and private policy making; this is the bedrock of our expert reputation. As we move into 2020 and beyond, we will increase our work with partners to develop and deliver solutions and strengthen accountability. Transparency and responsibility for decisions and their impacts on biodiversity will be essential to making progress towards the future biodiversity targets to be adopted in Kunming.
  -
    UNEP-WCMC will continue to work on the cutting edge of science, policy and practice. We will help to develop and urgently implement environmental agreements, including the new Global Biodiversity Framework. We will work across all sectors, from finance to fisheries, to develop the tools and knowledge they need to transform to truly sustainable business models. We will support the implementation of nature-based solutions to help the world mitigate and adapt to climate change and to progress across the Sustainable Development Goals.
  -
    This year and in the decade ahead, we will continue to partner with governments, businesses, NGOs and research bodies worldwide to make a positive impact for people and planet.
