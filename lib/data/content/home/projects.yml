          text: 
            - Protected Planet is an online portal into the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), the most comprehensive and authoritative global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas. A responsive tool, it is one of the key global biodiversity data sets for scientists, businesses, governments, international secretariats and others to inform planning and policy decisions and track progress towards various international targets.

          title: What is our role?
          text:
            - We manage both Protected Planet, with support from IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas, and the WDPA, a joint product of UN Environment and IUCN.
            - Since 2010 it has been a global goal to secure 17% of the land and 10% of the ocean in networks of effective protected areas.
            - In November we launched Protected Planet Live with IUCN and National Geographic to ensure the very latest information on progress towards this ambition is widely available. 
            - ProtectedPlanet Live shows progress on global coverage and also identifies where gaps and opportunities remain for strengthening the coverage of protected and conserved areas – and it’s good news! There has been excellent progress towards the global targets of 17% terrestrial and 10% marine coverage of protected areas. The next challenge is scaling up area-based conservation and ensuring those areas are effective.

          text: 
            - IBAT, the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, is a ‘one-stop shop’ data service for those seeking authoritative global biodiversity information to inform their decisions.
        -
          title: What is our role?
          text:
            - We manage IBAT on behalf of our other IBAT partners, IUCN, Birdlife International and Conservation International.
            - Many businesses and governments wish to understand their impacts on biodiversity – whether that’s to ensure their practices are sustainable in the long-term, to follow their own ethical or legal guidelines, or as required by external regulations. It’s often difficult, however, to understand the consequences of any plans or actions on biodiversity. 
            - "This is where IBAT came in – launched in 2010, it is underpinned by three of the world’s most authoritative global biodiversity datasets: the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas. Added functionality and expertise then allows people across businesses, governments, and the finance sector to screen potential projects and review potential risks in their investments or supply chain."
            - "Since the publication of their sustainability strategy and their collaboration with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has used IBAT as part of its Interested Cities and Candidate Cities processes: “Thanks to IBAT, we can ensure that biodiversity is taken into consideration from the very early stages of a city’s Olympic journey” says Michelle Lemaitre, Head of Sustainability at the IOC. “Based on data provided by IBAT, cities can ascertain whether proposed location plans for Olympic venues need to be modified to avoid impacting areas of high biodiversity value. They can also go a step further, looking into ways in which hosting the Olympic Games can contribute to biodiversity conservation in the area.”"

    introduction:
      - The oceans and coastal habitats provide us with food, protect us from extreme weather, and soak up carbon. They’re facing increasing pressures around the world, however, so we’re working throughout Europe to help restore these valuable environments.

          text: 
            - Marine and coastal habitats are immensely valuable, on both a local and global scale. Coral reefs act as nurseries for schools of fish, mangroves and seagrasses can stem tidal surges, and both the ocean and the life it holds act as sponges that soak up carbon. Many coasts and seas are facing increasing pressures, however, so marine habitat restoration projects are underway all over the world. 
        -
          text:
            - The UN declared 2021-30 as the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, and we are already involved in a number of initiatives to restore both regionally and internationally important marine and coastal habitats, and bring together evidence to guide future restoration efforts. 
            - We are working as part of the Marine Ecosystem Restoration in Changing European Seas (‘MERCES’) Project, for example, which has launched more than 130 restoration activities across 12 European countries since July 2016. By working with field scientists, ecosystem modellers and mappers, we will be able to bring together state-of-the-art advice for decision makers about the most efficient way to upscale these restoration efforts and create healthy ecosystems that support marine life, as well as the people that depend upon them.
            - The success of this project has led to the Algal Forest Restoration in the Mediterranean Sea initiative, where we will be looking specifically at the restoration of degraded seaweed forests across the Mediterranean - from southern Mediterranean to Northern Africa. 
            - We are also working with the Endangered Landscapes Programme in southwestern Turkey to see how, by reducing and removing such threats as illegal fishing, anchoring pressures and invasive species, we can recover the marine ecosystems that support critical species such as Mediterranean monk seals and sandbar sharks. One of our key areas of involvement is around behavioural change, and encouraging people to see invasive fish as a key food source.
            - We’ll be tracking progress and impacts for all these initiatives, so please do keep an eye on the UNEP-WCMC website where you can find more information about these and our other marine restoration activities.

    title: ENCORE for finance tool
    image: content/project-encore.png
    introduction: 
      - Business are central to reversing the decline of nature. However, in the past it has been difficult for them to fully understand their relationship with the environment and biodiversity. In November we therefore joined with the Natural Capital Finance Alliance to launch ENCORE, helping financial institutions to determine, for the first time ever, the dependence of over 150 economic sectors on nature.

          title: What is ENCORE?
          text:
            - ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure) helps private investors and the finance sector to visualise how the economy depends on nature, and how environmental change may create risks for businesses. These risks can be explored further in the tool to understand location-specific risks with maps of natural capital, such as soil and habitats, and the drivers of change that may influence them, such as floods and droughts.
        -
          title: What is our role?
          text:
            - We developed the knowledge base underpinning ENCORE and the web-based tool, in collaboration with the Natural Capital Finance Alliance. The project was financed by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the MAVA Foundation. 
            - Increasingly the conservation community is recognising that not only are businesses part of the solution to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation– they are indispensably critical. Businesses, and their influencers such as governments and financial institutions, are also recognising more and more that nature lies at the foundation of everything they do, but lacked the data and tools to fully understand the ways in which they depend on the natural world.
            - Last November we therefore launched ENCORE in collaboration with the Natural Capital Finance Alliance, helping financial institutions to determine, for the first time ever, the dependence of over 150 economic sectors such as manufacturing or agriculture on nature, and the associated risks that may impact their lending and investment portfolios.
            - "Madeleine Ronquest, Head of Environmental and Social Risk, Climate Change Management at FirstRand in South Africa, said: “ENCORE really helped us to get a more holistic view of potential impacts on our lending portfolio and to incorporate natural capital risk mitigation into all our lending and investments. We’re now adding questions into our due diligence process for all new credit transactions, asking our clients how they are managing environmental risk and assessing how resilient they are to climate change and natural capital risk."
            - “Many larger companies are already building resilience which is great, but smaller businesses in particular often haven’t considered their dependence or impact on natural resources. ENCORE gives us the opportunity to engage with our clients, build stronger trust relationships and help build more sustainable and resilient businesses.”

    title: The value of nature - starting with a nut
    image: content/nut.png
    introduction: 
      - The natural world is critical to Uganda’s economy and the wellbeing of its people, providing essential support for food security, tourism, and livelihoods around the country. Traditional ways of looking at economic progress, however, can neglect or exclude the values that nature provides. We therefore worked with partners to identify and highlight trends in the ‘stocks’ of several of Uganda’s biodiversity-related natural resources - with concrete consequences for the Shea nut.

            - The natural world is critical to Uganda’s economy and the wellbeing of its people, providing essential support for food security, tourism, and livelihoods around the country. However, traditional ways of looking at economic progress can neglect or exclude the values that nature provides. This means decision makers can’t take it fully into account, often leading to inefficient and unsustainable growth.
        -
          text:
            - To address this, we initiated a joint effort designed to inform decisions around how best to manage natural areas – how much to invest in them, and how declining wildlife undermines the Ugandan economy. By working closely with partners (the National Planning Authority, National Environmental Management Authority, Wildlife Conservation Society and the Institute for Development of Environmental-Economic Accounting (IDEEA) Group), we were able to identify and highlight trends in the ‘stocks’ of several of Uganda’s biodiversity-related natural resources.
            - Findings from the work contributed in 2018 to a nationwide short-term ban on cutting, transportation and sale of Shea nut tree logs and their products. These trees have great economic importance and real potential as an export product to cosmetics and food industries, but they are a threatened species and were under increasing pressure from illegal harvesting for logs, charcoal and the Shea nuts themselves. 
            - When scanning northern Uganda for areas that might suitable for Shea we found that most of the potential habitats were also not in protected areas – leaving them even more vulnerable to illegal harvesting. The Ugandan Government therefore decided on the short-term ban on their harvest, preserving the potential for Shea nut harvesting in the long-term.
            - In the coming year we will be also be taking this thinking to the oceans, and investigating the Blue Economy – deepening our understanding on the economic value of the oceans, and our own ability to support decision makers to take that into account.

    introduction: 
      - The ocean covers 70% of the planet, regulating our weather, storing carbon, and providing us with food. It is threatened, however, by a wide range of pressures including climate change, overharvesting, pollution, and development. In 2018 we therefore launched Ocean+ - a portal into ocean data that makes it as easy as possible for decision makers to understand and account for the ocean’s value.

            - "The ocean is our life support system: covering over 70% of the planet, it regulates our weather, stores carbon, and provides a home for many species that we depend on for our nutrition and livelihoods. Yet our actions—including those many miles from the coast—are affecting the health of the ocean, with climate change, overharvesting, pollution and other pressures from development threatening the continued supply of the services we all depend on."
            - "We therefore launched Ocean+ in January 2018, designed to make it as easy as possible for decision makers to better understand and account for the ocean’s value. By curating information through partnerships and networks with governmental, non-governmental, and business communities, Ocean+ allows users to:<ul><li>View and download quality-assured spatial datasets that are useful for policy and decision-making;</li><li>Locate more than 190 data resources globally that are important for marine and coastal biodiversity;</li><li>Learn about the state of knowledge on five ecologically-important ocean habitats, namely seagrasses, warm- and cold-water corals, saltmarshes, and mangroves.</li><li>Explore, through the associated initiative Protected Planet, nationally-validated statistics on marine protected area coverage all over the world.</li></ul>"
            - Ocean+ and complementary partnerships will become increasingly vital as the global community defines priorities for the upcoming United Nations ‘Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.’
