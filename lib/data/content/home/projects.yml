    title: A Live portal into our protected planet
    introduction: Since 2010 it has been a global goal to have protected areas across the world that could truly protect the species and ecosystems within them – having sufficient quality, as well as size. With only semi-regularly updated datasets, however, national leaders struggled to find if they were reaching these targets. So in November, we, IUCN, National Geographic and UN Environment launched Protected Planet Live, a regularly updated portal that shows where we as a global community can improve and expand upon protected areas. It is able to reflect the impact of a new government’s decisions and actions, encouraging collective action to halt the downward trend of biodiversity.

    title: Gold medal for mapping impacts of biodiversity
    introduction: "Launched in 2010, it is underpinned by three of the world’s most authoritative global biodiversity datasets: the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas. Added functionality and expertise then allows people across the businesses, governments, and the finance sector to screen potential projects and review potential risks in their supply chain."

    title: Marine restoration from Turkey to Norway
    introduction: Marine and coastal habitats are immensely valuable, on both a local and global scale - corals can act as nurseries for schools of fish, mangroves and seagrasses can stem tidal surges, and both the ocean itself and the life it holds can act as sponges that soak up carbon. Many places have already been over-harvested or degraded, however, and so restoration projects are underway all over the world. This is still a relatively new approach, however, and there is little information about how to do this efficiently, or successfully.

    title: Encore for finance tool
    introduction: More and more the conservation community is recognising that not only are businesses part of the solution to biodiversity loss – they are indispensably critical. Businesses themselves are also increasingly recognising that natural resources lie at the foundation of everything they do, but lacked the data and tools to fully understand their impacts.

    title: The value of nature starting with a nut
    introduction: Over the past year we have been working closely with the World Conservation Society and the IDEEA Group (Institute for Development of Environmental-Economic Accounting) to identify the value of Uganda’s natural resources – informing the placement of protected areas, how much to invest in them, and how declining biodiversity threatens Ugandan people. Shea butter tree nuts, for example, were seen to have potential as a local food source, as well as an export to cosmetics industries. They are a vulnerable species, however, prone to overharvesting, and so there was a real question of how to produce them in a way that would last. When scanning northern Uganda for areas that might be Shea butter nut-friendly, we found that most of the potential habitats were not in protected areas, and would therefore be prone to overharvesting. This resulted in a nation-wide ban on the trade in Shea butter nuts.
