            - "Starting in February 2019, the team spent the year setting up the project with all partners. This included inception meetings in all partner countries, launch events in Switzerland and Brazil, as well as a workshop in London to explore pathways to sustainability for agricultural commodity trade. Scoping studies are now underway, with some results supporting the UK's Global Resources Initiative and the development of the new Global Biodiversity Framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)."
            - "At the end of the project, we expect to have generated a number of outputs, outcomes and impacts."

          text:
            - Marine Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), commonly called the high seas, are those areas of the ocean for which no one nation has sole management responsibility. These areas make up 64% of the surface of the oceans. The Global Environment Facility's ${link-abnj-deep-seas-project}, a joint venture with the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme, explores options to manage these areas sustainably, following an ecosystem-based approach.

          title: What is our role?
          text:
            - We looked at how planning across different sectors – such as fishing, shipping, conservation, and mining — could better support the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in ABNJ. We then worked with governments and decision makers in the Southeast Pacific and the Western Indian Ocean, regional fisheries bodies, regional seas organisations, and sectoral and industry bodies, to increase their awareness and understanding of the challenges, interests, and opportunities in ABNJ, recognising the importance of a coordinated approach to balance ocean uses.

          title: What is our impact?
          text:
            - Over five years, the project team brought together knowledge, practices and innovative research on sustainable deep-sea fisheries management and biodiversity conservation in ABNJ. Our efforts have culminated in a series of technical outputs including a framework to guide and encourage spatial planning across multiple sectors in ABNJ. Since 2018, our results have been used to inform the development of a new international legally binding instrument to improve the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in ABNJ so that future generations may benefit from a healthy ocean.

          title: What is our impact?
          text:
            - Our insightful analysis and knowledge continue to shape and inform key international environmental policies. In May 2019, we produced a report, with expert input from fellow scientists and policymakers around the world, that collated crucial scientific information to inform targets and indicators for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and proposed ways to monitor progress.
            - Past biodiversity targets have sometimes been difficult to implement as they lacked underpinning scientific data and a clear way of monitoring progress. We are changing this by providing the knowledge needed to ensure future goals for biodiversity are ambitious, achievable, science-based and measurable. This is a vital step in tackling the global decline of nature.
            - In 2019, we also maintained and developed temporal indicators of change in nature that align with international environment agreements. These can be accessed through the ${link-biodiversity-indicators-partnership}. Moreover, we created new datasets that fill identified gaps, such as ${link-global-biodiversity-patterns}. Lastly, we continued to develop novel models that assess how changes in human activities impact nature now, and what could happen under different plausible futures through different ${link-agricultural-commodity-trades}.

          text:
            - Healthy ecosystems regulate our climate, provide food and clean water, protect us from natural disasters and are central to culture, wellbeing, and livelihoods. However, ecosystems across the world are being damaged, degraded and destroyed. 75% of our land and 66% of our seas are significantly impacted by human action, while more than 85% of the wetland area is already lost and 20% of native species across terrestrial biomes have disappeared.

            - UNEP-WCMC is providing strategic leadership, evidence-based expertise and project support to inspire, empower and enable governments, businesses, scientists and society to collectively foster the transformative change needed to drive the mass restoration of ecosystems. Throughout 2019 we collaborated with partners around the world to build capacity and create innovative solutions to environmental challenges through restoration.

          title: What is our impact?
          text:
            - 2021 will mark the start of the ${link-ecosystem-restoration} aiming to unite the world to prevent, halt and reverse ecosystem degradation. To support this, we have been convening governments and businesses to share science, knowledge, and insight to shape policy in favour of healthy landscapes and seascapes. In 2019, we created an integrated global map of biodiversity and carbon storage (${link-nature-map}) to help prioritise global restoration efforts. This information is already generating impact as it is being used by governments to make decisions on where they might target efforts to reverse biodiversity loss whilst also curbing greenhouse gas emissions from land use.
            - In parallel, with ambitious national and global targets being set for restoration, we supported the replication, implementation and upscaling of successful restoration efforts. For example, through our ${link-restore-plus-project}, we evaluated ecosystem restoration policy impact on biodiversity in Indonesia and Brazil. Moreover, from Norway to Tunisia, we are exploring innovative solutions to restore degraded coastal and deep-sea ecosystems across European Seas. Lastly, we have partnered with local and international experts to develop a strategy for climate resilient restoration of the ancient pastureland in southern Portugal, while in Latin America and the Caribbean, we have worked and continue to work with the private sector to highlight social and environmental co-benefits of restoring vulnerable rainforests.

          text:
            - Overexploitation of species is one of the most significant threats facing nature. With more than 180 Parties, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is addressing this threat. It is an agreement between governments aiming to regulate international trade in over 35,000 species of animal and plant to prevent overuse. Every three years, Parties gather to take stock and to discuss whether to tighten or loosen trade restrictions for individual species in light of their trade levels and conservation status - these meetings are known as the ${link-cop-medium} (CoP).
        -
          title: What is our role?
          text:
            - For CoP18, we worked closely with the European Union (EU) to analyse the suitability of over 200 species for listing in, or delisting from, the CITES Appendices, and assisted with the development of listing proposals for several species.
        -
          title: What impact did we have?
          text:
            - Working with the EU, we developed listing proposals for the Tokay gecko (one of the world's most highly traded reptile species), Grandidier's Madagascar ground gecko (a species endemic to the dry and spiny forests of Madagascar), and a threatened swallowtail butterfly that can only be found on a single island in the Philippines. All of these species will now benefit from increased levels of protection.
            - We translated key outcomes from CoP18 into two databases used by Parties to support their implementation of CITES – the CITES Checklist and Species+. This included updating entries of over 1,000 different species, including the addition of 143 species newly protected by their inclusion in the CITES Appendices. Having up-to-date and accessible data will enable countries to implement regulations that support sustainable trade.

          text:
            - A ${link-new-classification-system} for natural capital assets, published in the journal <em>Ecosystem Services</em> by UNEP-WCMC, was the first time both the renewable and non-renewable resources that provide benefits to people and the economy were comprehensively defined. This depth of information will provide a consistent 'language' for decision makers at all levels in the public and private sectors, in relation to the management of nature and the services it provides.
        -
          title: What is our role?
          text:
            - We developed the classification system when compiling the knowledge base which underpins our ${link-encore-tool}. Developed by UNEP-WCMC in partnership with the ${link-ncfa-long}, ENCORE helps financial institutions screen investments and loans for natural capital-related risk, and to incorporate this within existing risk management processes.
            - The development of ENCORE was funded by the ${link-seco-long} (SECO) and the ${link-mava} from 2017-2019, and will be funded by the ${link-foen-long} (FOEN) from 2019-2021.

          title: What impact did we have?
          text:
            - Our new system of classifying nature has practical applications for decision makers across public and private sectors, from national to site-level assessments.
            - "Katie Leach, Senior Programme Officer in UNEP-WCMC's Business and Biodiversity team and lead author of this paper, commented: \"We're very excited about this new classification system, and the potential it provides for a consistent language to include nature in decision-making. Before this, there was no single system for classifying all aspects of nature, so everyone was reporting it in different ways. Now both the public and the private sector can use the same language, ultimately leading to more consistent and holistic decision-making.\""
            - Financial institutions are one group of decision makers that could benefit from this consistent language through the use of ENCORE. Banks and investors need to understand how environmental degradation can disrupt the businesses that they lend to or invest in. For example, a degraded coastline could make infrastructure developments vulnerable to flooding, but by identifying, measuring and then monitoring those aspects of natural capital that provide protection, such as mangroves and corals, banks can make more informed decisions on whether to lend and how to better price products. This will drive positive impact on the ground as threats to nature are reduced and businesses understand how they depend on natural capital.
