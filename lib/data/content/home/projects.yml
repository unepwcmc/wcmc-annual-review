            - ${link-pp} is an online portal into the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), the most comprehensive and authoritative global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas. A responsive tool, it is one of the key global biodiversity data sets for scientists, businesses, governments, international secretariats and others to inform planning and policy decisions and track progress towards various international targets.

          text: 
            - In 2010 the international community made a commitment - to protect 17% of land and 10% of the ocean in well-managed protected areas around the world by 2020. As of August 2019 15% of land and nearly 8% of the ocean are covered in formally-designated protected areas, but there is still little information on how well these areas act as a network to conserve nature.
            - So in November 2018, UNEP, IUCN, and National Geographic Society launched ${link-pp-live}. This monthly-updated portal maintained by UNEP-WCMC is the global authority for protected areas information and shows progress towards these international protection targets, helping to prioritise the next steps in addressing the loss of nature.
            - Protected Planet Live shows progress on global coverage and also identifies where gaps and opportunities remain for strengthening the coverage of protected and conserved areas – and it’s good news! There has been excellent progress towards the global targets of 17% terrestrial and 10% marine coverage of protected areas. The next challenge is scaling up area-based conservation and ensuring those areas are effective.

            - Many businesses and governments wish to understand their impacts on biodiversity – whether that’s to ensure their practices are sustainable in the long-term, to follow ethical or legal guidelines, or as required by external regulations. It’s often difficult, however, to understand the consequences of any plans or actions on biodiversity. 
            - "This is where ${link-ibat} comes in - launched in 2010, it is underpinned by three of the world’s most authoritative global biodiversity datasets: the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and the World Database on Key Biodiversity Areas. Added functionality and expertise then allows people across businesses, governments, and the finance sector to screen potential projects and review potential risks in their investments or supply chains."
            - "Since the publication of their sustainability strategy and their collaboration with the ${link-iucn}, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has used IBAT as part of its Interested Cities and Candidate Cities processes: “Thanks to IBAT, we can ensure that biodiversity is taken into consideration from the very early stages of a city’s Olympic journey” says Michelle Lemaitre, Head of Sustainability at the IOC. “Based on data provided by IBAT, cities can ascertain whether proposed location plans for Olympic venues need to be modified to avoid impacting areas of high biodiversity value. They can also go a step further, looking into ways in which hosting the Olympic Games can contribute to biodiversity conservation in the area.”"

    introduction:
      - The oceans and coastal habitats provide us with food, protect us from extreme weather, and soak up carbon. They’re facing increasing pressures around the world, however, so we’re working throughout Europe to help restore these valuable environments.

            - Marine and coastal habitats are immensely valuable, on both a local and global scale. Coral reefs act as nurseries for schools of fish, mangroves and seagrasses can stem tidal surges, and both the ocean and the life it holds act as sponges that soak up carbon. Many coasts and seas are facing increasing pressures, however, so marine habitat restoration projects are underway all over the world. 
        -
          text:
            - The UN declared 2021-30 as the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, and we are already involved in a number of initiatives to restore both regionally and internationally important marine and coastal habitats, and bring together evidence to guide future restoration efforts. 
            - We are working as part of the ${link-merces-long} (‘MERCES’) Project, for example, which has launched more than 130 restoration activities across 12 European countries since July 2016. By working with field scientists, ecosystem modellers and mappers, we will be able to bring together state-of-the-art advice for decision makers about the most efficient way to upscale these restoration efforts and create healthy ecosystems that support marine life, as well as the people that depend upon them.
            - The success of this project has led to the ${link-algal} initiative, where we will be looking specifically at the restoration of degraded seaweed forests across the Mediterranean Sea.
            - We are also working with the ${link-endangered} in southwestern Turkey to see how, by reducing and removing such threats as illegal fishing, anchoring pressures and invasive species, we can recover the marine ecosystems that support critical species such as Mediterranean monk seals and sandbar sharks. One of our key areas of involvement is around behavioural change, and encouraging people to see invasive fish as a key food source.
            - We’ll be tracking progress and impacts for all these initiatives, so please do keep an eye on the ${link-wcmc-website} where you can find more information about these and our other marine restoration activities.

            - Businesses have a key role in the solutions to biodiversity loss. They themselves are also increasingly recognising that natural resources lie at the foundation of everything they do, but lack the data and tools to fully understand their dependencies and impacts.
            - Last November we therefore launched ENCORE in collaboration with the Natural Capital Finance Alliance, helping financial and other institutions to determine, for the first time ever, the dependence of over 150 economic sectors such as manufacturing or agriculture on nature, and the associated risks that may impact their lending and investment portfolios.
            - "Madeleine Ronquest, Head of Environmental and Social Risk, Climate Change Management at FirstRand in South Africa, said: “ENCORE really helped us to get a more holistic view of potential impacts on our lending portfolio and to incorporate natural capital risk mitigation into all our lending and investments. We’re now adding questions into our due diligence process for all new credit transactions, asking our clients how they are managing environmental risk and assessing how resilient they are to climate change and natural capital risk."
            - “Many larger companies are already building resilience which is great, but smaller businesses in particular often haven’t considered their dependence or impact on natural resources. ENCORE gives us the opportunity to engage with our clients, build stronger trust relationships and help build more sustainable and resilient businesses.”

    title: The value of nature - starting with a nut
    image: content/nut.png
    introduction: 
      - The natural world is critical to Uganda’s economy and the wellbeing of its people, providing essential support for food security, tourism, and livelihoods around the country. Traditional ways of looking at economic progress, however, can neglect or exclude the values that nature provides. We therefore worked with partners to identify and highlight trends in the ‘stocks’ of several of Uganda’s biodiversity-related natural resources - with concrete consequences for the Shea nut.

However, traditional ways of looking at economic progress can neglect or exclude the values that nature provides. This means decision makers can’t take it fully into account, often leading to inefficient and unsustainable growth.

            - To address this, ${link-joint-effort} designed to inform decisions around how best to manage natural areas – how much to invest in them, and how declining wildlife undermines the Ugandan economy. By working closely with partners (${link-planning-authority}, ${link-management-authority}, ${link-wildlife-conservation} and the ${link-ideea-long} (IDEEA) Group), we were able to identify and highlight trends in the ‘stocks’ of several of Uganda’s biodiversity-related natural resources.
            - In 2018, findings from the work contributed to a nationwide short-term ban on cutting, transportation and sale of Shea nut tree logs and their products. These trees have great economic importance and real potential as an export product to cosmetics and food industries, but they are a threatened species and were under increasing pressure from illegal harvesting for logs, charcoal and the Shea nuts themselves. 
            - When scanning Northern Uganda for areas that might be suitable for Shea we found that most of the potential habitats were also not in protected areas – leaving them even more vulnerable to illegal harvesting. The Ugandan Government therefore decided on the short-term ban on their harvest, preserving the potential for Shea nut harvesting in the long-term.
            - In the coming year we will also be taking this thinking to the oceans, and investigating the Blue Economy – deepening our understanding on the economic value of the oceans, and our own ability to support decision makers to take that into account.

Yet our actions—including those many miles from the coast—are affecting the health of the ocean, with climate change, overharvesting, pollution and other pressures from development threatening the continued supply of the services we all depend on."
            - "We therefore launched Ocean+ in January 2018 at the UN Biodiversity Conference in Egypt, designed to make it as easy as possible for decision makers to better understand and account for the ocean’s value. By curating information through partnerships and networks with governmental, non-governmental, and business communities, Ocean+ allows users to:<ul><li>View and download quality-assured spatial datasets that are useful for policy and decision-making;</li><li>Locate more than 190 data resources globally that are important for marine and coastal biodiversity;</li><li>Learn about the state of knowledge on five ecologically-important ocean habitats, namely seagrasses, warm- and cold-water corals, saltmarshes, and mangroves.</li><li>Explore, through the associated initiative Protected Planet, nationally-validated statistics on marine protected area coverage all over the world.</li></ul>"
            - Ocean+ and complementary partnerships will become increasingly vital in the run-up to 2020, when the global community will be shaping the future agenda for biodiversity, and in the time thereafter as we track progress towards future biodiversity targets.
