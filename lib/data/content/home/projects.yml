            - "UNEP-WCMC’s flagship ${link-protected-planet} is the authoritative source of global data and knowledge on protected and conserved areas. It is a collaborative, open-access platform that brings together a range of information on formally protected areas, and other notable conservation areas."
            - "In 2021, Protected Planet delivered the definitive report on progress towards Aichi Target 11 – the previous global 10-year target on protected areas – revealing that while targets on terrestrial coverage were met, progress in marine areas lagged behind, and we fell far short in delivering against them on the quality of these areas."

          text:
            - "Protected Planet revealed that at least ${link-wcmc-target-1}. With data still being submitted, it is clear that the world had exceeded the 17% coverage target in 2020. However, it is clear more needs to be done to ensure these areas are effective and deliver on ambitions for conservation. Less than 8% of protected land areas are connected to one another, and a third of key biodiversity areas remain unprotected."
            - "Meanwhile, coastal and marine areas remained below target, with ${link-wcmc-target-2}."
            - "In the years ahead, Protected Planet – and the suite of tools, data and resources we provided through it – will be a fundamental resource for governments tracking and reporting their progress on increasingly ambitious global and national targets for protected and conserved areas. It will also be crucial in supplying insights on the connectivity, effective management and equitable governance of these areas."

          text:
            - Understanding of and interest in the role nature-based solutions (NbS) can play to mitigate climate change and strengthen human development is growing. NbS contributions for carbon mitigation also features as a proposed new target in the post-2020 ambitions for nature.
            - New research from UNEP-WCMC and partners – released during the ${link-cop26} in Glasgow – found that an equitable and effective rollout of NbS across all ecosystems would have the power to ${link-wcmc-solutions}, increasing to 18 GtCO2e per year by 2050. This is equivalent to nearly 30% of the current annual global CO2 emissions, ${link-unep-report}.
            - Meanwhile, a UNEP-WCMC co-authored study outlined the climate importance of Europe’s peatlands and mapped the extent of their degradation. This ${link-wcmc-research}, and urgently called for improved management and restoration efforts to secure their future role in reducing climate change.<br/>UNEP-WCMC also released a ${link-NEA-pdf} highlighting the role that national ecosystem assessments, currently being developed by countries across the world; can play in addressing climate change, further strengthening connections between the climate and the biodiversity agenda.
            - Nature featured firmly in the climate discussions at COP26, and the UNEP-WCMC team spoke at more than 20 sessions, discussing and presenting on topics ranging from forest and peatland protection and transforming trade to support nature and climate.

          - In 2021, we collaborated with partners across the globe on cutting-edge knowledge and tools to promote effective spatial planning, and conducted pioneering research into biodiversity and nature-based solutions.
          - We worked with UN partners to collate hundreds of wide-ranging data layers – combining information from satellites, scientists in the field and indigenous and local communities – and maximised their utility in a new open-access cloud-based computer platform.
          - The resulting ${link-wcmc-lab} enables users to overlay state-of-the-art maps and data on nature, climate change, and human development. Launched in October 2021, after six months the platform had nearly 5,000 active users across governments and civil society, and is now being used to help countries generate action maps to locate where conservation and restoration actions can most efficiently contribute to achieving national priorities and international targets.
          - Meanwhile, our spatial data experts used novel modelling to ${link-wcmc-threats} on land, to help guide governments and businesses in developing conservation strategies. We also worked with partners on spatial analysis to demonstrate the climate and water benefits that would be gained from ${link-wcmc-objectives}.

            - Nature and natural capital are increasingly being recognised as crucial to sustainable commerce, development and societies, as well as climate resilience. Economists are backing biodiversity.
            - However, business and financial independencies with nature are hugely complex, and investors and individual businesses need help understanding their biodiversity reliance, impact and related risks.
            - In 2021, UNEP-WCMC worked with partners to launch a new biodiversity module, as part of the ${link-encore-tool} online natural capital planning platform. Initially focussed on agriculture and mining industries because of their particular exposure to biodiversity risks, the tool helps finance leaders to explore the impact and dependencies of specific portfolio investments on nature at local levels, so they can then take action to reduce biodiversity loss and levels of business risk. More than 30 financial institutions helped to trial the new module ahead of its release, and it is now available to nearly 1,000 ENCORE users worldwide.
