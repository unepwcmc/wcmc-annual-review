        The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) is vital to UNEP’s work driving positive change for people and planet. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed huge challenges on us all and is an urgent reminder of the importance of rebalancing the relationship between people and nature.

        Through the Centre’s expertise, information, and analyses, UNEP-WCMC is supporting the science, the policy and the action to tackle the global nature crisis. The Centre seeks to do so by providing the information and tools to help shape policy and enable business and the finance sector to make nature positive transformations. UNEP-WCMC is also at the heart of our work to bring the nature and climate agendas ever closer together. As we strive for system-wide shifts and transformation across each and every sector of society, UNEP-WCMC’s science and insights will be critical.

        During the course of 2020, WCMC took steps to strengthen its regional engagement and relationships across the world, in support of the collaboration that underpins UNEP-WCMC. This included fostering closer engagement in Asia and with EU institutions.

        Across all six areas of the Centre’s strategy, it’s clear that UNEP-WCMC has continued to support decision makers in both the public and the private sector with the information they need to make positive choices for our planet. From leading cutting-edge analysis of trade across a range of sectors, to enabling national governments to build biodiversity considerations into their decision making, UNEP-WCMC has made huge achievements, in a very challenging year. My thanks go to the WCMC Board of Trustees, to our supporters and to all our staff.

        Although 2020 was not the year that we expected, and many events in the international biodiversity community were postponed or repositioned online, our work continued at all scales. Through working in over 130 countries with more than 200 partners, UNEP-WCMC has had great impact during the year on the global nature and sustainability agenda.
      -
        The Centre continued crucial work in support of an ambitious and measurable post-2020 global biodiversity framework. If we are to succeed in addressing biodiversity loss and ensuring its benefits are enjoyed by all, then ambition will need to translate into action to deliver the framework. We are gearing up to support its implementation, including with our partners across the UN system through collective action on biodiversity and nature-based solutions.

        In 2021 we strengthened relationships with philanthropic funders, enabling us to diversify our income and increase strategic investment into projects and programmes. This critically important support has helped us to scale up our work in response to the urgent need to deliver greater impact for people and the planet.

        As a result of key donor funding, we are able to significantly build upon our work to support major progress for protected and conserved areas. We will continue to provide direct support to countries, as well making ongoing major investments in Protected Planet – the world’s authoritative source of data and knowledge on protected and conserved areas.  These efforts will support rapid, meaningful, and measurable progress towards national targets and new ambitious global conservation targets due to be agreed at the next UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15) in Kunming, China.
