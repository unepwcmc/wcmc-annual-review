        The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) provides crucial input to UNEP’s work driving positive change for people and planet. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed huge challenges on us all and is an urgent reminder of the importance of rebalancing the relationship between people and nature.

        Through the Centre’s expert tools, information, and insights, UNEP-WCMC is leading the way on tackling the global nature crisis, including by shaping international policy and enabling businesses to make nature positive transformations. UNEP-WCMC is at the heart of our work bringing the nature and climate agendas ever closer together. As we continue to work towards transformative change across all sectors of society, UNEP-WCMC’s expertise, collaboration and innovation will be critical.

        During the course of 2020, UNEP-WCMC has taken further steps to strengthen its regional engagement and relationships across the world. This includes continuing to build on the Centre’s global networks and fostering closer engagement with the Government of China and with EU institutions.

        Across all six areas of the Centre’s strategy, UNEP-WCMC has continued to give decision makers in both the public and the private sector the information they need to make positive choices for our planet. From leading cutting-edge analysis of trade across a range of sectors, to enabling national governments to build biodiversity considerations into their decision making, UNEP-WCMC has made huge achievements, in a very challenging year. As such, my thanks go to the Board of Trustees, to our supporters and our staff.

        2020 was not the super year for nature that many in the international conservation community expected. However, UNEP-WCMC continued to make great progress on the global nature and sustainability agenda, including by playing a pivotal role in mainstreaming biodiversity across the UN system.

        The Centre continued crucial work towards shaping an ambitious and measurable post-2020 global biodiversity framework. If we are to succeed in halting and reversing biodiversity loss, ambition will need to translate into support for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and into national and local action. To enable this, we focused particularly on the indicators for the new framework, helping to ensure that progress towards the new global goals will be meaningful, measurable and transparent.

        Throughout 2020, UNEP-WCMC staff demonstrated tremendous agility in dealing with the effects of the pandemic, constantly shifting circumstances, and transitioning to working remotely. It is a testament to the team’s hard work and dedication that last year, the Centre produced more high-quality outputs than in any other year in our history. I am immensely proud of and grateful for the UNEP-WCMC team’s brilliant efforts.

        Amongst the many achievements of 2020 was the Centre’s contribution to the ground-breaking Bending the Curve analysis which set out a path for halting and reversing terrestrial biodiversity loss from land use change. The futures modelling identifies the six key actions required, including ecosystem restoration and food system transformation. Such research, and the underpinning modelling, is one example of how we continue to inform and direct effective global action for nature.
