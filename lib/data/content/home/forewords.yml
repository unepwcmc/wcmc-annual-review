        During 2020, the Super Year for Nature, countries across the globe will come together to strike a new deal for nature, with new targets for the next decade. UNEP-WCMC is at the heart of UNEP's work during the Super Year, working at the interface of science and policy to help these international environment agreements to succeed.

        2020, the Super Year for Nature, is a crucial year for biodiversity, and for our planet. Data, evidence and research will be the bedrock of the new, post-2020 targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity, and due to our special collaboration with UNEP, UNEP-WCMC is uniquely placed to contribute.
      -
        Our aim is to ensure that the new targets are ambitious, achievable, science-based and measurable. This is critical to tackling the global decline in nature. That's why in 2020, we will continue to build on our work on ways to monitor real-world impact and progress. Read on to find out more.

        The future of nature hangs in the balance; never in its history has UNEP-WCMC been more essential. We understand the power of collaboration and work with partners across the world to create innovative solutions to environmental challenges. In 2019 we brought together governments, businesses, NGOs and research bodies to tackle some of the biggest drivers of environmental degradation.

        One such partnership - the Trade Hub - began in 2019 and is exploring how certain global trade pathways in agricultural commodities are causing biodiversity loss. The results are already feeding into public policy while equipping companies with the knowledge they need to transition to more sustainable business models.
