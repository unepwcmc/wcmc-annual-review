        The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre is an important part of the UNEP family and has a unique role in working with partners across the world to deliver impact towards a nature-positive future. The Centre’s work at the interface of science, policy and practice supports governments, the private sector and others in taking on board biodiversity information in better decision-making for people and nature.
      -
        As we move towards adoption of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the Centre’s support for its implementation and enhanced transparency, whether through helping governments to strengthen national monitoring systems or supporting business to understand their impacts and dependencies on nature, will be more important than ever.

        In spite of the difficulties arising from the Covid pandemic, UNEP – WCMC has had a really good year. Throughout this period, the Centre’s staff were able to deliver on a wide range of work that was essential for the delivery of the biodiversity agenda. They were also able to provide continuing support for our partners (including government and international agencies) around the world.
      -
        It is a strength of the collaboration between WCMC and UNEP that underpins all the centres activities. Our work benefits considerably from our presence around the world – with WCMC staff in Asia, mainland Europe and Latin America located in UNEP offices or working in close collaboration. The Board would like to offer their sincere thanks to the staff, UNEP colleagues and partners across the globe – all of whom have contributed to a very successful year.

        Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting progress in international negotiations during the previous year, UNEP-WCMC's work to support the international agenda on biodiversity, to further scientific understanding, and to guide national and private sector actions to assess, monitor and manage biodiversity continued apace. This Annual Review presents some of the highlights from our work last year, and many further details of our impacts can be found on our website.
      -
        Our impacts in the year demonstrate a further growth of our work at the Centre to integrate the multiple dependencies between nature, climate and sustainable development. We have strengthened outreach and engagement with public, business and finance partners to help guide system transformation, and will continue to strengthen relationships with partners across all sectors to scale up our impact through ensuring that policies and action for nature are informed by the latest data, knowledge and insight.

        In the last year the Centre strengthened its relationships with philanthropic funders, enabling a growth and diversification of income, and increasing strategic investment into projects and programmes. During the year, the Centre worked with 232 partners on 250 projects, spanning 81 countries and territories, and the staff numbers working at the Centre increased by more than 20% to a team of almost 200 people across 35 nationalities.
      -
        We have also taken steps to update our office environment and ensure that all staff receive support to work effectively through our hybrid working arrangements, and refined our staffing structures to ensure they are fit to deliver on the new UNEP-WCMC strategy.
