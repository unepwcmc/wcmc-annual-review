    title: "Championing #GenerationRestoration"
    introduction:
      - We helped launch the ${link-ecosystem-restoration}, supporting an international campaign and resource hub to mobilise and inform the world about the urgency of restoring and safeguarding nature. The campaign launch saw the release of the ${link-becoming-generation-restoration} report, authored by a team including UNEP-WCMC experts.

    title: Ensuring sustainability in Africa’s infrastructure boom 
    introduction:
      - UNEP-WCMC leads the ${link-dcp}, a collaborative research initiative which works to fill gaps in understanding around the environmental and social impacts of large-scale linear infrastructure development. In 2021, we completed a global review of biodiversity impacts of development corridors and compiled a corridors database for Africa.

    title: Protecting Oceans
    introduction:
      - UNEP-WCMC combined marine biodiversity datasets into an upgraded ${link-wcmc-oceans}, a highly functional data platform enabling governments and businesses to map and manage key ocean ecosystems. We also helped develop and launch a ${link-wcmc-MPA} on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to help policymakers and practitioners understand the level and type of protection that MPAs can offer.

    title: Strengthening collaboration on a post-covid planet 
    introduction:
      - Though UNEP-WCMC continued to operate as a largely virtual organisation throughout 2021, the Centre’s staff continued to work tirelessly to progress our global partnerships and knowledge sharing. We organised numerous online conferences, webinars and training sessions, but also helped shape discussions at major in-person summits, including ${link-ukcop26}.

    title: Promoting nature’s role in urban resilience 
    introduction:
      - In China, we helped two cities better understanding their interdependencies with nature. We pursued our collaboration with the provincial capital ${link-wcmc-Chengdu} to support its Green Belt ecological zone and measure the impact of its green infrastructure projects. We also began work with one of China’s largest cities, ${link-wcmc-Shenzhen}, quantifying the benefits and use of nature in urban planning.

    title: Unlocking natural capital accounting for Uganda 
    introduction:
      - Through our four-year Darwin Initiative-funded project ${link-wcmc-Uganda}, we have worked with Ugandan and international partners to develop three sets of natural capital accounts (NCA), now adopted by the Ugandan government. The findings and resources developed during this project contributed to creating a blueprint for other countries interested in deploying NCA.

    title: Mapping biodiversity threats 
    introduction:
      - "With UN partners, we launched in October the ${link-wcmc-lab}. Combining information collected from satellites, scientists in the field, indigenous people and local communities, this free platform provides users with more than 400 data layers to explore and map the interaction between nature, climate change, and human health and development. As a result of the platform's launch, the hashtag #UNBiodiversityLab gained 7 million viewers and 35 million impressions on social media, which helped expand the platform's membership to over 5,000 today."

    title: Integrating nature across the UN system
    introduction:
      - In 2021, we played a major role in the development and adoption of a ${link-un-pdf}, which outlines crucial connections between nature, society and the economy and champions the integration of considerations for nature across the UN system in support of member States’ action for biodiversity.
