    title: Feeding into global goals for biodiversity
    introduction: We supported the UN Biodiversity Conference in Egypt, a biennial global event to set international goals and action plans for biodiversity. A number of decisions specifically refer to our background documents including decisions around visions for 2050, and how to instil biodiversity into decision making in the energy and mining, infrastructure, manufacturing and processing sectors.

    title: Tracking international wildlife trade
    introduction: We helped to assess whether trade in 27 different “species-country combinations” were sustainable as part of the CITES’ Review of Significant Trade process, including eel (Anguilla anguilla) from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and African teak (Pericopsis elata) from Cameroon, DRC and Congo. As a result, the range States for eel and African teak were asked to implement more conservation export quotas, and Cameroon’s export of African teak was determined to be at a sustainable level.

    title: Bending the curve on biodiversity loss
    introduction: Neil Burgess, our Chief Scientist, co-published a paper with proposals for how to ‘bend the curve’ of biodiversity loss. By unifying biodiversity models from all over the world the authors were able to ask what might happen to biodiversity under different global scenarios, and set out the necessary steps to create a roadmap for the future of biodiversity. Critically, the paper emphasises that conservation success depends largely on actions in sectors such as agriculture, business and finance.
